One that is shared and contains normalization, boilerplate, default yahdrib\r\ntheme and your custom mobile theme.\r\n\r\n    The `shared.min.css` is the base of all: normalization, base of theme,\r\nand mobile styles. In developement, there is 3 separated files (_css/dev_).\r\nSo that it's much more understandable, readable, and easy to customize.\r\n\r\n    But remember, it's made for mobile, so keep it stupidly simple (*KISS*).\r\n\r\n2. An other one with the CSS for the wider screens.\r\n    \r\n    The `wider.min.css` contains rules for large and intermediate screens.\r\nHere, CSS are more for enhanced page layout, theme, etc.\r\n\r\n3. At least, the `helpers-print.min.css` is a final tiny one for the helpers,\r\nnon semantic stuff, and print rules.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What's inside\r\n\r\n__yahdrib__ uses the following librairy:\r\n\r\n> [html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) | [v3.0.1](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/zipball/v3.0.1)\r\n\r\n> [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com) | 2.5.2 html5-boilerplate build\r\n\r\n> [Respond](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) | [1.1.0](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/blob/c82ab674098de89ca5a144ea236a5697011b807c/respond.min.js)\r\n\r\n> Enhanced [normalize.css from Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) | [Feb 07, 2012 release](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/commit/5e5496c026a0211ac2fdfd62cb59e25455dced55)\r\n\r\n> A custom resolution independent design\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Get ready, and customize\r\n\r\n* index.html\r\n\r\n    Replace / customize / fill in the `<head>` section such as the title,\r\ndescription, keywords, author, Google Webmaster site verification ID, sitemap,\r\nfeeds (Atom / RSS), etc.\r\n    \r\n    Of course customize the different `<body>` text contents. And at least,\r\nthe JavaScript, jQuery, and Google Analytics ID if needed.\r\n    \r\n    Remove unnecessary code and comments for production environment.\r\n\r\n* humans.txt\r\n\r\n    Fill in the `/* TEAM */`, `/* THANKS */`,  and `/* SITE */` sections.\r\n    See http://humanstxt.org/ for more information about it.\r\n\r\n* CSS files\r\n\r\n    Customize values, or remove unchanged, from `css/dev/01-yahdrib-theme.css` file.\r\n    \r\n    Add your own custom CSS for mobiles to `css/dev/02-yahdrib-mobile.css` file.\r\n    \r\n    Add your custom CSS for wider media to `css/dev/wider.css` file.\r\n    \r\n    For production environment, merge and minify the follwing files into one single `css/shared.min.css` file.\r\n\r\n  1. `css/dev/00-normalize-h5bp-yahdrib.css`\r\n  2. `css/dev/01-yahdrib-theme.css`\r\n  3. `css/dev/02-yahdrib-mobile.css`\r\n\r\n    \r\n    Also minify `css/dev/wider.css` into `css/wider.min.css`.\r\n\r\n* Extra, but well appreciated\r\n\r\n    Clone, fork, give some feedback, comment, or whatever. Talk about how you like it !\r\n","tagline":"Yet Another HTML5 Device Resolution Independent Boilerplate","google":"UA-8246495-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
